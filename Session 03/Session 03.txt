Spread and rest operator

its syntax almost same but use cases are different

when it's used in array or object it is called spread 
when it's used in functions it is called rest operator 
symbol (...<variable name>)

note : when it's used in object we can add also object braces {}


spread it is also called destructuring

it's only 3 dots and bthen variable name


delete keyword its also an operator 

//in looping   let obj1 = obj.reduce((start,end)=>{return updated values},start);

Module 5: Loops
for
while
do-while

for-in
for-of
for-each 

its is methos of array or object but behaviour like loops 

filter,map,reduce 
 break & conƟnue
 Nested loops 

what is loop 
loop is called multiple of arrays iteration or object iteration or or  collection iteration 

for loop 
syntax 

i++,++i,i--,--i

for(initialization,condition,increment or decrement){
    body
}


while(condition){

body
increment or decrement 
}

do while 

execute at least one time and then check condition 

break and continue

it's used in control statements


Advance in javascript loops

1.fot in loop 
for(variableName in object/array);

note it's easy for object iteration and returns key property 

in cpp array is a pointer and pointer is internally array 

2. for of loop 
for(variableName of array);

note it's easy for array iteration and returns value

3. For Each 
its used for elements 
Array methods 
Each elements returns a function 

syntax 
arrayName.forEach(function(){});

it's returns 3 parameters 
    1. value
    2.index
    3.original element or   array
